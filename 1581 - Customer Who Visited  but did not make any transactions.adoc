== SQL Schema

[source,sql]
----
Create table If Not Exists Visits(visit_id int, customer_id int)
Create table If Not Exists Transactions(transaction_id int, visit_id int, amount int)
Truncate table Visits
insert into Visits (visit_id, customer_id) values ('1', '23')
insert into Visits (visit_id, customer_id) values ('2', '9')
insert into Visits (visit_id, customer_id) values ('4', '30')
insert into Visits (visit_id, customer_id) values ('5', '54')
insert into Visits (visit_id, customer_id) values ('6', '96')
insert into Visits (visit_id, customer_id) values ('7', '54')
insert into Visits (visit_id, customer_id) values ('8', '54')
Truncate table Transactions
insert into Transactions (transaction_id, visit_id, amount) values ('2', '5', '310')
insert into Transactions (transaction_id, visit_id, amount) values ('3', '5', '300')
insert into Transactions (transaction_id, visit_id, amount) values ('9', '5', '200')
insert into Transactions (transaction_id, visit_id, amount) values ('12', '1', '910')
insert into Transactions (transaction_id, visit_id, amount) values ('13', '2', '970')

=== Approach 1 - Using `NOT IN`/`EXISTS`

.Steps
. Remove the transactions that have transactions using `NOT IN`
+ 
[source,sql] 
----
SELECT visit_id FROM Transactions
----
+
. Count the visit ids for each customer id excluding the visits that we identified in the subquery from the visits table & rename the column as requested by the final output.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    customer_id,
    COUNT(visit_id) AS count_no_trans
FROM
    Visits
WHERE
    visit_id NOT IN (
        SELECT
            visit_id
        FROM
            Transactions
    )
GROUP BY 
    customer_id
----

=== Approach 2 - Removing Records Using `LEFT JOIN` & `IS NULL`

.Steps
. Exclude visits that involved transactions from the complete set of visits using `LEFT JOIN`.
.. From Visits v (visits is left table)
.. Left join Transactions t on v.visit_id = t.visit_id 
.. where t.visit_id IS NULL
.. group by customer_id
